**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  Interpreting user needs is done through the interview process. Ask questions so User Stories can be made based on this criteria: As a <role> I want <to be able to do something> so that <benefit> A collection of these user stories are all collected into a project.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  Developing programs can be approaches by breaking user stories into work items. If there are enough items and enough time then work is divided into sprints. Each sprint is short and poignant and accomplishes specific task towards the larger goal of moving the project into production. Daily stand ups are good check ins for the team at large while Project Owners and Scrum Masters keep backlogs and goals tidy and in sight.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  A good team member is a good communicator. It's far more valuable to be a crumby developer who keeps the team up to date, than a good one who no one can get a hold of. Of course we need good code, but surprises hurt the project more than clean code benefits it in the grand scheme. This applies to all roles of the team. If you can communicate and couple that with accountability, then you've got a winner.
